# qcircuits
Quantum Circuit Simulator

example_usage.ipynb - Contains examples of the functionality for this simulator. Circuits are sparse matrices and states are sparse vectors\

qctools.py - Creates a class object for building quantum circuits, evolving initial states, and outputting results in human-readable form\

gateset.py - Contains predefined standard gates for building quantum circuits\

circuitgrad.py - Contains functions for determining gate rotations via gradient descent\

functions.py - Contains specialized functions for simulating the models in the paper below\

XYmodel_simulations.ipynb - Contains code for running all simulations and creating all plots that appear in the paper below\
